<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>India’s weather is
extremely varied, something you must take into account when thinking about the
best time to travel. The most influential feature of the Subcontinent’s climate
is the wet season, or&nbsp;<b>monsoon</b>. This breaks on the Keralan coast at
the end of May, working its way northeast across the country over the following
month and a half. While it lasts, regular and prolonged downpours are
interspersed with bursts of hot sunshine, and the pervasive humidity can be
intense. At the height of the monsoon – especially in the jungle regions of the
northwest and the low-lying delta lands of Bengal – flooding can severely
disrupt communications, causing widespread destruction. In the Himalayan
foothills, landslides are common, and entire valley systems can be cut off for
weeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>By September, the
monsoon has largely receded from the north, but it takes another couple of
months before the clouds disappear altogether from the far south. The east
coast of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and the south of Kerala, get a second
drenching between October and December, when the “northwest” or “retreating”
monsoon sweeps in from the Bay of Bengal. By December, however, most of the
Subcontinent enjoys clear skies and relatively cool temperatures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>Mid-winter sees the
most marked contrasts between the climates of north and south India. While
Delhi, for example, may be ravaged by chill winds blowing off the snowfields of
the Himalayas, the Tamil plains and coastal Kerala, more than 1000km south,
still stew under fierce post-monsoon sunshine. As spring gathers pace, the
center of the Subcontinent starts to heat up again, and by late March
thermometers nudge 33°C across most of the Gangetic Plains and Deccan plateau.
Temperatures peak in May and early June, when anyone who can retreats to the
hill stations. Above the baking Subcontinental land mass, hot air builds up and
sucks in humidity from the southwest, causing the onset of the monsoon in late
June, and bringing relief to millions of overheated Indians.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>The best time to
visit most of the country, therefore, is during the&nbsp;<b>cool, dry season</b>,
between November and March. Delhi, Agra, Varanasi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
are ideal at this time, and temperatures in Goa and central India remain
comfortable. The heat of the south is never less than intense but it becomes
stifling in May and June, so aim to be in Tamil Nadu and Kerala between January
and March. From this time onwards, the Himalayas grow more accessible, and the
trekking season reaches its peak in August and September while the rest of the
Subcontinent is being soaked by the rains.</span></p>
