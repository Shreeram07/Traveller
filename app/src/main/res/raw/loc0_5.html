color:#222222'>Every country has certain cultural and practical ‘rules’,
however formal or informal. Brazil is no different. As a foreign tourist, it is
a good idea to become familiar with the general do’s and don’ts so that you are
comfortable and do not offend the locals of your destination. So, here are some
tips:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;background:white'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif;
color:#222222'>DO:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif;
color:#222222'>• Make eye contact with those around you, even as you walk
through the streets and marketplaces, or travel on public transport. This is
considered to be normal and polite. It is also a safety measure, as pickpocket
thieves are known to prey on those who do not make eye contact (since they can,
presumably, not identify the people around them and the perpetrator of the
crime).&nbsp;<br>
• Be a careful, alert pedestrian, looking carefully before crossing the street.
This is a busy country, with plenty of traffic.&nbsp;<br>
• Leave the bulk of your money and important paperwork (passport, driver’s
licence, etc...) in a safe place at your accommodation. Carry only the money
you need for the day with you. If necessary, make photocopies of your paperwork
to carry with you and leave the originals at your hotel.&nbsp;<br>
• Pickpocketing is, unfortunately, a threat, particularly in bustling areas,
full of locals and tourists making their way around the beautiful cities of
Brazil. Therefore, when visiting a very busy area, do not wear valuable
jewellery (including wristwatches) and do not carry cameras, money and wallets
anywhere in or from which they can easily be seen or taken.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
150%;background:white'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif;color:#222222'>• If you are the victim
of any sort of crime, be sure to report it to the tourist police
immediately.&nbsp;<br>
• If you are going to be visiting a busy area, wear your backpack backwards, so
that it hangs on your chest, not behind you.&nbsp;<br>
• Always check with your hotel if certain areas are safe, or if they advise
that you do not visit them. Take their advice to heart.&nbsp;<br>
• Get a taxi rather than a bus for long distance travel. They are reasonably
priced and safe.&nbsp;<br>
• Brazilian locals are generally very helpful and often quite friendly. Accept
their help if they offer it to you.<br>
• If you need to draw money, choose an ATM inside a mall or bank rather than
one on the street.&nbsp;<br>
• Wear walking shoes (not hiking boots), shorts and a plain T-shirt to fit in
with the locals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;background:white'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif;
color:#222222'>DON’T:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;background:white'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif;
color:#222222'>• Get drunk. Brazilians are not often drunk and do not respect
others that indulge in far too much alcohol.&nbsp;<br>
• Do drugs. It is illegal to use or be in possession of drugs in Brazil.&nbsp;<br>
• Make use of prostitutes. They often supplement their income by robbing their
clients.&nbsp;<br>
• Opt for really cheap accommodation. Small accommodation providers are
generally not willing to provide lodging for foreigners (which they may do, but
begrudgingly) and may not offer the safety and conveniences of larger
establishments.&nbsp;<br>
• Leave your luggage, shopping or any other personal possessions
unattended.&nbsp;<br>
• Give money to beggars and street children. Although these ones pose little or
no physical danger to you, they should not be supported financially.<br>
• Walk in the streets or along the beaches after dark.</span></p>
