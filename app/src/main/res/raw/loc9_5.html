style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'><br>
<span style='background:white'>Do</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>greet people with a namaste. To show respect
towards the Indian customs greet them with a namaste, which is a slight bow
with both hands placed together.</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Do</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>be polite, but persistent when dealing with
business. Indian business is slow and difficult, but instead of becoming angry,
firmly restate your proposal with a smile. Count on several visits before an
agreement is finally made.</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Do</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>allow hosts to serve you. Hosts feel obligated
to keep your plate full, but it is not required for you to finish all of it.</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Do</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>ask permission to smoke. It is considered rude
to smoke in front of the elderly.<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Do's Part II</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Do</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>negotiate prices. As a foreigner you may be
quoted a price much higher than that Indians would normally pay. Never accept
the price, even at markets.</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Do</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>point with your chin, whole hand, or thumb.
Pointing with only one or two fingers is improper and only used when
communicating with inferiors.</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Do</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>arrive to a gatherings 15-30 minutes late.<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Do</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>politely turn down offers of beverages and snacks
if you don't want them. Generally you will be offered these numerous times once
you have accepted it.</span><br>

font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'><br>
<span style='background:white'>Don't</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>wear tight or revealing clothing. Indians have
adopted a very conservative way of dressing where men are rarely seen wearing
shorts and women don't wear skirts exposing their ankles. Covering shoulders
and legs when visiting temples in India are extremely important, and you will
gain respect if you do so.</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Don't</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>wear your shoes inside. It is good manners to
remove shoes when going into someone's house, certain shops, a temple, or
mosque. There are special shoes designated to be worn inside of a house, but
never outside.</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Don't</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>kiss or hug in public. These are looked on as
acts of sex, even holding hands is often frowned upon, although some Indian men
may hold hands to show &quot;brotherliness&quot;.</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Don't</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>stand too close to Indians. They value their
personal space and generally allow an arm's length from themselves and others.</span></span></p>

line-height:150%;font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif;background:white'>Don't</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'><br>
<span style='background:white'>point your feet at people. Feet are considered
unclean, so it is important to avoid pointing them or touching objects and
people with them. If you do so, you must apologize right away. On the other
hand, it is a symbol of respect to bend down and touch an elderly person's
feet.</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Don't</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>eat or pass objects with your left hand. The
left hand is considered unclean, just like feet, because it is used to perform
matters associated with going to the bathroom.</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>Don't</span><br>
<span style='background:white'>be offended by intrusive questions. Indian
people often don't &quot;mind their own business&quot;, due to the lack of
privacy and personal space in India. As a result avoid being surprised or
offended if someone asks how much your salary is. Instead engage in
conversation and feel free to ask them similar questions.</span><img width=780
